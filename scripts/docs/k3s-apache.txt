To assign an HTTPS certificate to your Apache server running in a Kubernetes cluster, follow these general steps:

### 1. Obtain an SSL Certificate
You can obtain an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) or use a tool like Let's Encrypt for a free certificate. 

### 2. Create a Secret in Kubernetes
Store your SSL certificate and private key in a Kubernetes Secret. Run the following command, replacing `tls.crt` and `tls.key` with your certificate and key filenames:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret --cert=path/to/tls.crt --key=path/to/tls.key
```

### 3. Update Your Apache Configuration
Modify your Apache configuration to use the SSL certificate. In your `httpd.conf` or a specific virtual host file, add the following:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName your-domain.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/tls.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/tls.key

    # Other configurations
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
</VirtualHost>
```

Make sure to adjust the paths to match where the certificate files are mounted in your container.

### 4. Mount the Secret in Your Pod
Update your Apache deployment YAML to mount the Secret containing your SSL certificate and key. Hereâ€™s an example snippet:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: apache-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: apache
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: apache
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: apache
        image: httpd:latest
        volumeMounts:
        - name: tls-secret
          mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: tls-secret
        secret:
          secretName: my-tls-secret
```

### 5. Expose the Service
If you haven't already, expose your Apache service using a LoadBalancer or Ingress resource. Here's an example of an Ingress resource for TLS:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: apache-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - your-domain.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret
  rules:
  - host: your-domain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: apache-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### 6. Test Your Configuration
After applying the changes, test your configuration to ensure the SSL certificate is working correctly. You can use tools like `curl` or visit the domain in a browser.

### 7. Monitor Logs
Check the Apache logs for any errors or issues that may arise during the setup.

### Final Notes
Make sure that your DNS is correctly pointing to the load balancer or Ingress controller for your domain. If you're using Let's Encrypt, consider automating certificate renewal with a tool like Certbot or using cert-manager in Kubernetes.

Multiple 

Yes, you can mount multiple TLS certificates in your configuration, but how you do it will depend on the specific application or service you're using. If you're using a tool like Helm to manage your deployment, you can structure your values file to handle multiple secrets.

### Example for Helm Values File

If you're configuring a Helm chart, you can define multiple secrets and certificates like this:

```yaml
tls:
  enabled: true
  autoGenerated: false
  existingSecrets:
    - name: my-tls-secret-1
      certFilename: tls.crt
      certKeyFilename: tls.key
      certCAFilename: ca.crt
    - name: my-tls-secret-2
      certFilename: tls2.crt
      certKeyFilename: tls2.key
      certCAFilename: ca2.crt
```

### Adjusting Your Application to Support Multiple Certificates

1. **Modify Your Deployment**: Ensure your deployment or pod configuration mounts all the necessary secrets. You can mount each secret to a different path within the pod.

2. **Update Configuration**: Your application configuration (like `httpd.conf` for Apache or similar) needs to be adjusted to point to the appropriate paths for each certificate. For example:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName your-domain.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/tls1.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/tls1.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca1.crt

    # Additional configurations
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName another-domain.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/tls2.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/tls2.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca2.crt

    # Additional configurations
</VirtualHost>
```

3. **Ingress Configuration**: If you are using Ingress, you can specify multiple TLS entries for different hosts:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: multi-tls-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - your-domain.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret-1
  - hosts:
    - another-domain.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret-2
  rules:
  - host: your-domain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: another-domain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Notes
- Ensure each secret contains the correct certificate and key files.
- Adjust the paths in your Apache configuration accordingly.
- Validate that the ingress controller or web server supports multiple certificates and is configured properly.
