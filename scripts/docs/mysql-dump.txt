#Note: exit from mysql and then run in normal terminal
#Note: enter passowrd when asked 

single db:
mysqldump -u <uname> -p db_name > db_backup.sql

whole db:
mysqldump -u <uname> -p --all-databases > all_db_backup.sql

if it's specific tables within a DB, then:
mysqldump -u <uname> -p db_name table1 table2 > table_backup.sql

You can even go as far as auto-compressing the output using gzip (if your DB is very big):
mysqldump -u <uname> -p db_name | gzip > db_backup.sql.gz

If you want to do this remotely and you have the access to the server in question, then the following would work (presuming the MySQL server is on port 3306):
mysqldump -P 3306 -h [ip_address] -u [uname] -p db_name > db_backup.sql
